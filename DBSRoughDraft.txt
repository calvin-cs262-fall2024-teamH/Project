Relationships
Users and Courses are connected via TutorCourses, which tracks which tutors teach which courses.
Appointments link students to tutors for specific courses, while Messages enable communication between participants in real time.
Reviews allow students and tutors to give each other feedback, personally I think that reviews should be specific to an appointment so the feature isnt abused.
