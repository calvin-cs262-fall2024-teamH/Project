# Tutors Hub
College students often struggle to understand challenging course material when the lectures from professors or available tutoring resources provided by Calvin University fall short. Many of them turn to this tutoring system on campus, only to find that there is a limited amount of subjects that have tutoring services or the lack of availability of flexible hours since there aren't many tutors to help out. TutorsHub addresses these needs by connecting students who seek academic assistance with peers who are happy to share their knowledge and passion for their subjects which they've shown previous success in. It is proven that one of the most effective methods to learning is through peer to peer collaboration, so by providing a platform where students can easily find and hire tutors who are also students, we plan to take advantage of the proven success of peer-to-peer learning to foster an effective atmosphere of learning.

Unlike standard tutoring systems, which can be limited and rigid, TutorsHub operates on a peer-to-peer principle. Our platform allows students to register as tutors, where they can put in volunteer hours  while helping others succeed in courses theyâ€™ve shown previous good success in. This crowdsourced approach increases the availability of tutoring options across a wide range of classes. On top of that, we also intend to have a rating/review system where students can rate tutors and write reviews which both increases the trustability of tutors and keeps everything dynamic. With TutorsHub, students gain access to personalized support from fellow learners who understand their challenges, making the learning experience more relevant and effective.
