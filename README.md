Hello, we are Team Hallelujah. We, like all college students, have had difficulties with class work at least once throughout our time at Calvin. 
Sometimes the lectures of the professors are just not descriptive enough of the course material so you start branching out to try other forms of education like the school’s 
tutoring system but sometimes the course you are looking for tutoring doesn’t have enough tutors, or sometimes no tutoring even exists for a course. 
Introducing TutorsHub: a place where students can be given the opportunity to help other students in a course they are both good and passionate about. 
Tutors will be able to monetize their knowledge and experience whilst students will get help in various classes. We plan on doing this by creating two forms of login: tutor and student. 
Students who want to be tutors can list the classes they’d like to give help with and their profiles can be sorted and listed by class. Students who need tutoring can go into the app, 
choose the course they need tutoring with, select a tutor by looking at their profile and meet up with them for teaching. If they are satisfied or dissatisfied about certain aspects, 
they can write reviews and give ratings about their tutor which boosts engagement and establishes a peer-reviewed environment. This way, students can properly learn their course material 
and tutors can be paid for their hard work. Instead of trying to figure out dated PowerPoint presentations and watching Youtube videos from obscure creators, sign up for TutorsHub 
and enlist the help of those who have gone through the difficulties of your class and learn the neat tips and tricks from someone who knows the struggle.
